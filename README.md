# AUTOMATED-REPORT-GENERATION



















# Automated Report Generation with Python

This project demonstrates an automated report generation system using Python. The script reads data from a CSV file, analyzes it using the `pandas` library, and generates a well-formatted PDF report using the `FPDF` library.

## Project Overview

The automated report generation process is designed to simplify data analysis and reporting. It allows users to upload a structured data file (like a CSV), processes the data to calculate key metrics, and outputs a PDF report with the findings. This project can be customized for various datasets, making it a powerful tool for reporting in multiple domains.

## Features
1. **Data Input**: Reads data from a CSV file for analysis.
2. **Automated Analysis**: Provides summary statistics (e.g., mean, min, max, count) for numerical and categorical data.
3. **PDF Generation**: Produces a well-structured and easy-to-read PDF report.
4. **Customizable**: The script is modular, making it easy to expand for additional functionality like data visualization.

## Prerequisites
To run the script, ensure the following are installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python Libraries:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `fpdf`: For generating PDF reports.
